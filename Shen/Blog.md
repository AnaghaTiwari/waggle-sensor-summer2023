I did all of the trainings and student orientation, and I did not have time to start working on the project yet. 
I spent most of the day doing the training exams and went to have lunch at around 12. I was able to get a rundown from Seongha on what 
I should be doing for my project.

I got started on preprocessing the data. I actually made more progress today than I thought. I was able to create my personal directory in github, and start the blog along with create another directory storing my progress in the project. I was able to convert the Solar Irradiance data that was given by Seongha into a CSV file(at first I attempted to use JSON but quickly found out that the formatting wrong and would take too long to format it correctly). I used the Pandas package in order to scrape the data from the CSV file (I also had to reformat the CSV File to only contain days from the summer along with formatting it correctly to show the correct amount of columns in Colabs). Furthermore, I also created a plot that shows the solar irradiance throughout the whole summer, so that I can get a better idea of how many classes I should use for my overall model.

Today, I was notified that we should only be measuring solar irradiance during the certain times of the day when the sun is likely to be out rather than times at night. Furthermore, I cleaned all the data for the images in order to retain only the images that are timestamped between 6:00AM and 8:00PM using Pandas and the Date Time library from python. I coded a function that would only pick one image per 15 minutes so I can eventually match the images with each row of data from the CSV file. There is is still a disparity between the number of rows of data in the Solar Irradiance and the number of images that I processed; I will continue to work toward closing this disparity so the index of a row can correspond to both the image and the respective Solar Irradiance
