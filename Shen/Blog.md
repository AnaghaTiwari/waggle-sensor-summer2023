I did all of the trainings and student orientation, and I did not have time to start working on the project yet. 
I spent most of the day doing the training exams and went to have lunch at around 12. I was able to get a rundown from Seongha on what 
I should be doing for my project.

I got started on preprocessing the data. I actually made more progress today than I thought. I was able to create my personal directory in github, and start the blog along with create another directory storing my progress in the project. I was able to convert the Solar Radiation data that was given by Seongha into a CSV file(at first I attempted to use JSON but quickly found out that the formatting wrong and would take too long to format it correctly). I used the Pandas package in order to scrape the data from the CSV file (I also had to reformat the CSV File to only contain days from the summer along with formatting it correctly to show the correct amount of columns in Colabs). Furthermore, I also created a plot that shows the solar radiation throughout the whole summer, so that I can get a better idea of how many classes I should use for my overall model.
