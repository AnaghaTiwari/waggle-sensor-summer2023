# Solar Irradiance 
by Alex Shen

Hello, my name is Alex Shen, and I am a incoming second year undergraduate student at Northwestern University. I work at Argonne National Laboratory this summer as a SULI intern. I spent my time at Argonne working on a model that uses deep learning to estimate the Solar Irradiance of the sun. I managed to get the model completed and built my plugin in the ECR on the sage website.
