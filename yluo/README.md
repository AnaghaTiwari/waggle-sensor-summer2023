# ANL summer 2023 project for Yufeng Luo

This directory has Yufeng's summer research project at ANL. Yufeng
will mainly work using these two git repos:
- [Cloud images](https://github.com/Brookluo/cloud-pred) (private)
- [VICReg](https://github.com/Brookluo/vicreg-sage) (public)

Yufeng's meeting note should be on the google drive, and daily logs will be available
in this directory. Still tunned!

How to reach Yufeng?

Using Waggle-sensor slack or email [brookluo34@hotmail.com](mailto:brookluo34@hotmail.com).
